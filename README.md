# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
![car factory](/Resources/car_factory.jpg)

### Purpose 
1. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the miles per gallon (mpg) of MechaCar prototypes.

2. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.

3. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.

4. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 
### Technologies Used:
- R / RStudio
- CSV
